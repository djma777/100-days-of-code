## Day 1. July 23, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site

### **Thoughts**

- I decided to take a day break from cs50 lessons, reading ydkjs, and udemy course, but restarted my portfolio project. It's looking better for now and will see how much I can add in the following days.

## Day 2 & 3. July 24 - 25, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site

### **Thoughts**

- Continuing the portfolio project, made some progress with single random quote and single random joke generator. On to random cats, however, I'm at a roadblock where I have yet to figure out how to size dynamically called images getting different sizes. I'm currently using a library that gives a nice transition to the image however it's using a aspect ratio prop. I may try to disable that prop when I come back to this tomorrow or figure out a totally different solution.

## Day 4. July 26, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site
- open source team project

### **Thoughts**

- I'm studying how to not get a 404 when refreshing on my app.
- Good meet with the team, almost about to start coding (the team), after finishing db design and some wireframing (also the team).

## Day 5. July 27, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site
- 1st day new job

### **Thoughts**

- So I will have to correct this tomorrow but I removed my App state that used to Redirect visitors to my `/welcome` page becuase it was not jibing with the static page solution I found on stackoverflow. I'll have to find a different ('better') way to redirect visitors.
- First day on my job as an Operations Manager (part-time) for a tech company. I wouldn't be coding but I will see the entire work flow of many projects, will be able to talk to clients, project managers, developers, and the BIG BOSS. Not to mention I will see real project codes.

## Day 6. July 28, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJS
- Codewars
- Portfolio

### **Thoughts**

- Read about Hoisting. I believe I understand how it works. I think I already did. I'm still confused about the difference between "declarations", "statements", "expression", and maybe more termnilogies. Like, I can imagine how they're different, but it's not exactly set in stone yet in my mind model. Need more learning!!!
- Finished one challenge that seemed pretty easy, and the top 1 solution wasn't very far from my own. I'm pretty happy with the result.
- Random image api from unsplash is not yet working how I want it to. I'm not able to, make another call to the same url for some reason, the image is not changing. I'll probly need to trigger an effect when the button is pushed.

---

## Day 7. July 31, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJS
- Codewars

### **Thoughts**

- apparently I missed two days already. i'm still getting on boarded at my new work, so there are still a lot of things I need to wrap my things around to be good at my job.
- Read about closures (again). Although I can understand the gist of it, I'm not yet confident enough to say that I already know it. I'm reading it again tomorrow.
- Solved a problem on Codewars, not very happy with my solution it was 10+ lines longer than the top solution, but it works. Still learning.
- Wasnt able to continue with anything else yesterday.

---

## Day 8. August 1, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars
- YDKJS: Scope & Closures

### **Thoughts**

- Solved a Kata, but my solution is yet close to what I would like it to be. So much to learn.
- I think it's a little bit clearer now, althought there's that example code with `module manager` that I still couldn't quite grasp how the code works. But I'll have to return to that tomorrow, and perhaps just that for this same chapter.
  - I may also need to learn how to configure my nodejs projects to use es6 modules using babel or something.

---

## Day 9. August 2, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars
- Portfolio Project

### **Thoughts**

- Solved a Kata. But just like yesterday... the top solutions were way way way way way way shorter than mine. Still so much to learn in programming and JavaScript!!!! I love it!
- I will not be using the RandomImage component because at the moment I could not figure out how to rerender the img element with the same api (random)url but change the image. It works fine without it. The page is currently just for entertainment anyway while I'm building the more important contents of my portfolio.
- I think I found the solution to the images, but there's the part where the height might be too large, and if I change my css to accomodate the height then it might break the width. This may need more testing, and reading on my part.

---

## Day 10. August 3, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars
- YDKJS > Appendix A: Dynamic Scope

### **Thoughts**

- Solved a Kata today. My solution wasn't bad, I actually kind of like my solution better than the top 1. The top solution was very concise but I wasn't sure about the intent of each expression chained together. But it was really using implicit coercion that I would have otherwise not thought possible. Learned that. I'm still very excited about learning (achieving a higher mastery of the language). More!!!
- So this is a new concept I never knew about. Pretty cool though, but more details about it is in another book. We'll get there eventually.

## Day 11. August 4, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Installing Python
- freeCodeCamp Python

### **Thoughts**

- Finally got the outcome I wanted, for `python -V` and `py -V` to show the latest version I installed which is `3.8.5` instead of `2.7.17` which was showing yesterday and early today. Hopefully that doesn't break anything on my end.
- Doing at least 1 or 2 lessons in Python at the freeCodeCamp site per day.

---

## Day 12. August 5, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars
- YDKJS > Appendix B: Polyfilling Block Scope
- freeCodeCamp Python

### **Thoughts**

- Solved a time Kata today. It was not difficult but, the way the top solution works is a little bit difficult for my mind to understand. I mean, `%` confuses me a bit when it was used. I don't quite understand (yet) how the result in the modulus operation results to minutes or seconds, but I kind of do understand - just not fully.
- So just a short topic, seeing as it is an Appendix Chapter, i'm not sure what tha difference is between `Traceur` and `Babel`. And by looking up they are competitors of each other, apparently.
- Slowly getting into Python... Just some basics. Lesson today is just about variables and expression. Very basic stuff. So... `constants` in Python is same as `primitives` in JavaScript? I guess so.

## Day 13. August 6, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars

### **Thoughts**

- couldn't quite solve this anagram kata today. spend almost 4 hours already going round and round the `for each` and `for of` loops that I've tried but mind hasn't quite gotten it yet. I'm still mind boggled or whatever. haha. it's fun. I'm just a little pressed for time and I need to do other stuff. I will continue to try to solve this tomorrow. It actually already ate up my supposed time for reading and freeCodeCamp Python lessons. But it's all good.
