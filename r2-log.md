## Day 1. July 23, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site

### **Thoughts**

- I decided to take a day break from cs50 lessons, reading ydkjs, and udemy course, but restarted my portfolio project. It's looking better for now and will see how much I can add in the following days.

## Day 2 & 3. July 24 - 25, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site

### **Thoughts**

- Continuing the portfolio project, made some progress with single random quote and single random joke generator. On to random cats, however, I'm at a roadblock where I have yet to figure out how to size dynamically called images getting different sizes. I'm currently using a library that gives a nice transition to the image however it's using a aspect ratio prop. I may try to disable that prop when I come back to this tomorrow or figure out a totally different solution.

## Day 4. July 26, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

## Day 5. July 27, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site
- 1st day new job

### **Thoughts**

- So I will have to correct this tomorrow but I removed my App state that used to Redirect visitors to my `/welcome` page becuase it was not jibing with the static page solution I found on stackoverflow. I'll have to find a different ('better') way to redirect visitors.
- First day on my job as an Operations Manager (part-time) for a tech company. I wouldn't be coding but I will see the entire work flow of many projects, will be able to talk to clients, project managers, developers, and the BIG BOSS. Not to mention I will see real project codes.

## Day 6. July 28, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJS
- Codewars
- ..Portfolio

### **Thoughts**

- Read about Hoisting. I believe I understand how it works. I think I already did. I'm still confused about the difference between "declarations", "statements", "expression", and maybe more termnilogies. Like, I can imagine how they're different, but it's not exactly set in stone yet in my mind model. Need more learning!!!
- Finished one challenge that seemed pretty easy, and the top 1 solution wasn't very far from my own. I'm pretty happy with the result.
- ...to be continued, will work on the portfolio next.
