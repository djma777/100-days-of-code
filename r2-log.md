### **Thoughts**

- I decided to take a day break from cs50 lessons, reading ydkjs, and udemy course, but restarted my portfolio project. It's looking better for now and will see how much I can add in the following days.

## Day 2 & 3. July 24 - 25, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site

### **Thoughts**

- Continuing the portfolio project, made some progress with single random quote and single random joke generator. On to random cats, however, I'm at a roadblock where I have yet to figure out how to size dynamically called images getting different sizes. I'm currently using a library that gives a nice transition to the image however it's using a aspect ratio prop. I may try to disable that prop when I come back to this tomorrow or figure out a totally different solution.
