## Day 1. July 23, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site

### **Thoughts**

- I decided to take a day break from cs50 lessons, reading ydkjs, and udemy course, but restarted my portfolio project. It's looking better for now and will see how much I can add in the following days.

---

## Day 2 & 3. July 24 - 25, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site

### **Thoughts**

- Continuing the portfolio project, made some progress with single random quote and single random joke generator. On to random cats, however, I'm at a roadblock where I have yet to figure out how to size dynamically called images getting different sizes. I'm currently using a library that gives a nice transition to the image however it's using a aspect ratio prop. I may try to disable that prop when I come back to this tomorrow or figure out a totally different solution.

---

## Day 4. July 26, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site
- open source team project

### **Thoughts**

- I'm studying how to not get a 404 when refreshing on my app.
- Good meet with the team, almost about to start coding (the team), after finishing db design and some wireframing (also the team).

---

## Day 5. July 27, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site
- 1st day new job

### **Thoughts**

- So I will have to correct this tomorrow but I removed my App state that used to Redirect visitors to my `/welcome` page becuase it was not jibing with the static page solution I found on stackoverflow. I'll have to find a different ('better') way to redirect visitors.
- First day on my job as an Operations Manager (part-time) for a tech company. I wouldn't be coding but I will see the entire work flow of many projects, will be able to talk to clients, project managers, developers, and the BIG BOSS. Not to mention I will see real project codes.

---

## Day 6. July 28, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJS
- Codewars
- Portfolio

### **Thoughts**

- Read about Hoisting. I believe I understand how it works. I think I already did. I'm still confused about the difference between "declarations", "statements", "expression", and maybe more termnilogies. Like, I can imagine how they're different, but it's not exactly set in stone yet in my mind model. Need more learning!!!
- Finished one challenge that seemed pretty easy, and the top 1 solution wasn't very far from my own. I'm pretty happy with the result.
- Random image api from unsplash is not yet working how I want it to. I'm not able to, make another call to the same url for some reason, the image is not changing. I'll probly need to trigger an effect when the button is pushed.

---

## Day 7. July 31, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJS
- Codewars

### **Thoughts**

- apparently I missed two days already. i'm still getting on boarded at my new work, so there are still a lot of things I need to wrap my things around to be good at my job.
- Read about closures (again). Although I can understand the gist of it, I'm not yet confident enough to say that I already know it. I'm reading it again tomorrow.
- Solved a problem on Codewars, not very happy with my solution it was 10+ lines longer than the top solution, but it works. Still learning.
- Wasnt able to continue with anything else yesterday.

---

## Day 8. August 1, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars
- YDKJS: Scope & Closures

### **Thoughts**

- Solved a Kata, but my solution is yet close to what I would like it to be. So much to learn.
- I think it's a little bit clearer now, althought there's that example code with `module manager` that I still couldn't quite grasp how the code works. But I'll have to return to that tomorrow, and perhaps just that for this same chapter.
  - I may also need to learn how to configure my nodejs projects to use es6 modules using babel or something.

---

## Day 9. August 2, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars
- Portfolio Project

### **Thoughts**

- Solved a Kata. But just like yesterday... the top solutions were way way way way way way shorter than mine. Still so much to learn in programming and JavaScript!!!! I love it!
- I will not be using the RandomImage component because at the moment I could not figure out how to rerender the img element with the same api (random)url but change the image. It works fine without it. The page is currently just for entertainment anyway while I'm building the more important contents of my portfolio.
- I think I found the solution to the images, but there's the part where the height might be too large, and if I change my css to accomodate the height then it might break the width. This may need more testing, and reading on my part.

---

## Day 10. August 3, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars
- YDKJS > Appendix A: Dynamic Scope

### **Thoughts**

- Solved a Kata today. My solution wasn't bad, I actually kind of like my solution better than the top 1. The top solution was very concise but I wasn't sure about the intent of each expression chained together. But it was really using implicit coercion that I would have otherwise not thought possible. Learned that. I'm still very excited about learning (achieving a higher mastery of the language). More!!!
- So this is a new concept I never knew about. Pretty cool though, but more details about it is in another book. We'll get there eventually.

---

## Day 11. August 4, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Installing Python
- freeCodeCamp Python

### **Thoughts**

- Finally got the outcome I wanted, for `python -V` and `py -V` to show the latest version I installed which is `3.8.5` instead of `2.7.17` which was showing yesterday and early today. Hopefully that doesn't break anything on my end.
- Doing at least 1 or 2 lessons in Python at the freeCodeCamp site per day.

---

## Day 12. August 5, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars
- YDKJS > Appendix B: Polyfilling Block Scope
- freeCodeCamp Python

### **Thoughts**

- Solved a time Kata today. It was not difficult but, the way the top solution works is a little bit difficult for my mind to understand. I mean, `%` confuses me a bit when it was used. I don't quite understand (yet) how the result in the modulus operation results to minutes or seconds, but I kind of do understand - just not fully.
- So just a short topic, seeing as it is an Appendix Chapter, i'm not sure what tha difference is between `Traceur` and `Babel`. And by looking up they are competitors of each other, apparently.
- Slowly getting into Python... Just some basics. Lesson today is just about variables and expression. Very basic stuff. So... `constants` in Python is same as `primitives` in JavaScript? I guess so.

---

## Day 13. August 6, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars

### **Thoughts**

- couldn't quite solve this anagram kata today. spend almost 4 hours already going round and round the `for each` and `for of` loops that I've tried but mind hasn't quite gotten it yet. I'm still mind boggled or whatever. haha. it's fun. I'm just a little pressed for time and I need to do other stuff. I will continue to try to solve this tomorrow. It actually already ate up my supposed time for reading and freeCodeCamp Python lessons. But it's all good.

---

## Day 14. August 12, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars
- YDKJS > Scope & Closures: Appendix C and D

### **Thoughts**

- I actually did some coding the past few days but I just wasn't able to log my progress. It's fine though, I'm happy to internalize the progress and skip logging them. But as much as possible I want to be responsible enough to keep this log going, even though i'm not really updating on social media most of the time.
- So in codewars, apparently, when I logged in today, I no longer have the same Kata that I was trying to solve before. But to my advantage, I guess, I got a new one and was able to solve it. Maybe I just got better? or maybe not? Hehe. What's more important is that I'm really happy that my skills are improving. And there's still so much to learn.
- Ok, cool, so `this`, yeah, gotcha! No, not really, not yet. So arrow functions behave differently in that they automatically have lexical-this so that coders do not need to bind. And arrow functions are anonymous. Pretty sure will learn more about this in later books in the series. Cool!

## Day 15. August 13, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars
- YDKJS > this & Object Prototypes > Ch1: _this_ Or That?

### **Thoughts**

- Failing to solve a kata today. I'll have to bail on this and continue trying tomorrow, because it's almost time for work and I haven't done any of my other daily tasks.
- So basically just started on this book, and the current chapter just explains what `this` is not. Well, of course, it's my first time reading the book so I haven't fully grasped the content yet, but I get some bits of it. Looking forward to the rest of the book and this book series.

## Day 16. August 14, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- freeCodeCamp: Python

### **Thoughts**

- Just taking 1 or 2 lessons a day. Nothing much. Just `if elif else` pretty much.

## Day 17. August 17, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars
- YDKJS: Ch2: `this` & Object Prototypes > `this` All Makes Sense Now!

### **Thoughts**

- Ok, I'm giving up on 5 kyu and higher for now. I want to solve easier, beginner friendly problems for now, until such time that I feel confident that I'm better than the 6 kyu below katas.
- It actually doesn't. Haha! But it will, I actually speed read through this chapter, with the intention of reading it again tomorrow, because I'm a little bit pressed with time. I'm definitely going to understand this and all these books in this series.

## Day 18. August 26, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars
- YDKJS: this & Object Prototyps > Ch3: Objects

### **Thoughts**

- So I skipped almost a week huh!? Been really busy preparing for the arrival of my new puppy next month. Bought a few stuff, and have been reading about pet training. I'm really excited about it.
- Today I solved a Kyu6 Kata. And learned about `trim()` after solving the kata without it. Lols!
- I'm learning but I don't have enough concentration to push through the whole Chapter, because I'm running a little late on my other commitment. I'm definitely going back and reread this chapter until I finish it at the right pace.

## Day 19. August 27, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Codewars
- Personal Website

### **Thoughts**

- Hmm... Solved a Kata but wasn't quite close to the top solution. Top solution used filter. I know filter but I missed the fact that you can do some algo inside besides the rule you want to return. Interesting.
- I also might alternate between Codewars and HackerRank, I was told the site is pretty good too. I'll start on it tomorrow.
- Couldn't quite progress on my personal website. I still need the design. And I'm not so sure yet how it's going to be. There are things that pop in mind whenever I think but I cannot fully engage myself in it. Partly because I have a very incompetent PC. I couldn't use design tools and research simultaneously. I will figure this out for sure. But it's going to take some more time.

## Day 20. August 28, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- HackerRank

### **Thoughts**

- So I guess I'm not doing a lot of coding or studying today. It's my sister's birthday and I had to go with my dad to buy some food for a small lunch celebration.
- Did a couple of the 10 days of Practice on HackerRank. Not a bad experience so far. I think alternating it with Codewars would work just fine.
- I'm still getting a bit anxious about the pace of my work on my personal and business websites. We'll get there.

## Day 21. August 31, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJS: this & Object Prototypes > Ch3: Objects
- Personal Site

### **Thoughts**

- I think I got a better run at this chapter now. But I honestly have parts I don't fully understand yet. I don't expect myself to fully comperehend everything at once. I'm going through all these learning slowly, at my own pace; and become a master in the right time.
- Took too long to fix the flickering issue. So using `StylesProvider` with prop `injectFirst` fixes the initial, and worst, flickering on reload or first load. Now I still have the problem with the font. Preloading might fix it, but at the moment it's not too big for me to focus on it. I'll move on and hopefully get more going on the site. There's so much to do yet after this.

## Day 22 - 23. September 10 - 11, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Personal Site

### **Thoughts**

- So first of all, the reason I have not progressed in the past week or so is because I recently got a Golden Retriever dog. She's quite a handful and still is. There's real good reason that I got her and is paying off quite a good lot. However, my coding journey is being affected. I don't regret it one bit, but I'll be doing my best to get back on track. There's also a good side of it with regards to my programming practice because I don't have a good enough computer yet that will handle my programming needs efficiently. It will all workout in due time. God is with me!
- So, I'm making small bits of progress on my personal site.
  - Yesterday, I started trying to integrate prismic.io and read the docs.
  - Today, I'm able to query documents and looks like I'd be able to understand the rest of it.
  - I still need to read a lot on Next.js and Prismic.io.

## Day 24. September 12, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Personal Site

### **Thoughts**

- I did a few modifications:
  - added a few page links to the appbar: Home, About, Blog, Contact
  - only home and blog are working, the other two are empty links which will result to a 404 if clicked.
- Still reading up on Next and Prismic.io docs.

## Day 29. October 12, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- New PC setup
- Patient Medical Records Backend

### **Thoughts**

- I'm very excited with my new PC. With this I can develop any software I want. Spent the weekend installing and playing/testing games and installing setting up some dev stuff. But mostly for dev stuff today.
- Also just setting up the project (PMR) on my new machine. And I really need to get a solid understanding of architecture and file structure. There's a lot to learn. I'm trying to Google the best resource to guide me how to build the API.

## Day 30. October 13, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- New PC setup
- Patient Medical Records Backend

### **Thoughts**

- Still currently in the process of setting up my pc for development. I'm about 99% done, just leaving that 1% for the things that I still don't know about.
- Currently also studying stuff in the lines of Software Architecture and SoftwareDesign.

## Day 31. October 14, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Hacker Rank
- New PC setup
- Patient Medical Records Backend
- RN Setup/ Android Studio

### **Thoughts**

- Solved 2 hacker rank problems. Second one took me a while to figure out. It was just about using switch statements. LOL. Happy it worked in the end.
- Installed a few VS Code extensions and configured Prettier to work. For some reason I don't know, the settings won't work, I had to add a snippet in the config file.
- Created a spike ticket for the PMR project architecture and proposed to rethink the scope or the whole project. I think we need to create a Hospital Management System instead.
- I was able to start a test RN project and able to see changes when I edit the code. Yay!

### **Thoughts**

- Happy to run through the course. Don't know how much a certificate will cost, right now I'm auditing the courses I enrolled myself to with a scholarship I mentioned yesterday.
- Made some progress on my redo of the Color App project. To be honest, after just probably a couple weeks of not coding, I already feel very rusty, and indeed I am. I really need to be consistent and more dedicated to this. And I am.
