## Day 1. July 23, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site

### **Thoughts**

- I decided to take a day break from cs50 lessons, reading ydkjs, and udemy course, but restarted my portfolio project. It's looking better for now and will see how much I can add in the following days.

## Day 2 & 3. July 24 - 25, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site

### **Thoughts**

- Continuing the portfolio project, made some progress with single random quote and single random joke generator. On to random cats, however, I'm at a roadblock where I have yet to figure out how to size dynamically called images getting different sizes. I'm currently using a library that gives a nice transition to the image however it's using a aspect ratio prop. I may try to disable that prop when I come back to this tomorrow or figure out a totally different solution.

## Day 4. July 26, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

## Day 5. July 27, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- portfolio site
- 1st day new job

### **Thoughts**

- So I will have to correct this tomorrow but I removed my App state that used to Redirect visitors to my `/welcome` page becuase it was not jibing with the static page solution I found on stackoverflow. I'll have to find a different ('better') way to redirect visitors.
- First day on my job as an Operations Manager (part-time) for a tech company. I wouldn't be coding but I will see the entire work flow of many projects, will be able to talk to clients, project managers, developers, and the BIG BOSS. Not to mention I will see real project codes.

## Day 6. July 28, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJS
- Codewars
- Portfolio

### **Thoughts**

- Read about Hoisting. I believe I understand how it works. I think I already did. I'm still confused about the difference between "declarations", "statements", "expression", and maybe more termnilogies. Like, I can imagine how they're different, but it's not exactly set in stone yet in my mind model. Need more learning!!!
- Finished one challenge that seemed pretty easy, and the top 1 solution wasn't very far from my own. I'm pretty happy with the result.
- Random image api from unsplash is not yet working how I want it to. I'm not able to, make another call to the same url for some reason, the image is not changing. I'll probly need to trigger an effect when the button is pushed.

## Day 7. July 31, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJS
- Codewars

### **Thoughts**

- apparently I missed two days already. i'm still getting on boarded at my new work, so there are still a lot of things I need to wrap my things around to be good at my job.
- Read about closures (again). Although I can understand the gist of it, I'm not yet confident enough to say that I already know it. I'm reading it again tomorrow.
- Solved a problem on Codewars, not very happy with my solution it was 10+ lines longer than the top solution, but it works. Still learning.
- Wasnt able to continue with anything else yesterday.
