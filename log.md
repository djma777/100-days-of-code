**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: February 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** At first I thought, this being my 2nd time working on the project would be significantly easier, but it wasn't. My code, I believe is a lot cleaner that it was the first time, thought not yet at a level I'm satisfied at. I really like the progress I made since September last year: the working code I was able to write today, took me almost 3 weeks to accomplish 5 months ago. To be continued tomorrow...
