### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: February 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** At first I thought, this being my 2nd time working on the project would be significantly easier, but it wasn't. My code, I believe is a lot cleaner that it was the first time, thought not yet at a level I'm satisfied at. I really like the progress I made since September last year: the working code I was able to write today, took me almost 3 weeks to accomplish 5 months ago. To be continued tomorrow...

### Day 1: February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp and revisiting Redux, data structures sections on the fcc curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I wrote quite a lot of custom hooks today. A lot for me at least. And I love it - not the pain in my head though. I'm still not passing some tests that I couldn't quite figure out, I decided to post for help on the fcc forum. Hopefully get some answers tomorrow, and finish the project with or without help. I felt that I needed to revisit some topics on the fcc curriculum and so I am doing just that.

### Day 2: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I refactored most of my code today, but still ended up with almost the same problem. I'm feeling optimistic that I will finish the project tomorrow.

### Day 3: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Well, I couldn't quite finish it today, but at least I got to 28/29. I'm hoping to get some answers from my freeCodeCamp forum post to help me solve the last test failure. It seems like a really eassy problem but I couldn't just figure it out for some reason. Looking forward to tomorrow.

### Day 4: February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp. 29/29. Finish the design tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I'm very pleased to have finally achieved 29/29 on the tests. I've barely started designing the app, but my brain is now to exhausted. I will finish this design tomorrow.

### Day 5: February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Pomodoro Clock project today. Small Victories!

**Thoughts:** I finished my basic design on the project, and cleaned up my files a bit. After these I'm revisiting redux, react-redux lessons on freecodecamp. It feels easy as expected -- what a relief, but I'm not going through like a breeze because I haven't mastered React and Redux at all. I will keep pushing!

### Day 6: February 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Revisiting D3JS lessons at freeCodeCamp in order to complete visualization certificate.

**Thoughts:** I've been considering myself a full stack javascript developer (very beginner level) for a few months now because I know both front end and back end, but I have yet to complete the freeCodeCamp full stack curriculum. I still need to finish the d3 projects (data visualization). Although I have finished the lessons a few months back, that time my mind was overloaded with all the fresh learning in HTML, CSS, Front end libraries, etc. Revisiting it now, to my surprise (but somewhat expected), I actually am absorbing the lessons much easier and I can dare say I actually understand the \*\*\*\* I'm reading. I'm stoked!

---

### Day 7: February 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning the D3JS docs for my freeCodeCamp Data Visualization Certification.

**Thoughts:** Today I spent more time reading the d3js docs than coding... Hoping I would be able to make some significant progress tomorrow. Also had some difficulty publishing to github pages. Maybe I'll make progress with that also by tomorrow.

### Day 8: February 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Bar Chart Project.

**Thoughts:** There is so much to learn in visualization. I'm finishing this project just getting the 14/14 score with very minimal details and design.

### Day 9: February 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Scatterplot Graph Project.

**Thoughts:** I haven't done much today. First half of the day we didn't have internet connection, so I binge watched the second half of Netflix's Altered Carbon. I was able to render the xAxis of the graph. Working on the yAxis, it is rendered on the correct side, but i'm still learning how the data is plotted. Back at this tomorrow.

---

### Day 10: March 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished Scatterplot Graph project 16/16.

**Thoughts:** I feel the guilt of cheating to pass a test... But, I have no other way of learning D3 but to see and study someone else's code and write it myself. The documentation isn't comprehensive enough for a newbie like me. I feel like you have to have actual knowledge in Data Science or Data Visualization itself, to be able to fully comprehend the D3 docs. But I'm confident I'm learning the code as I study and rewrite it for my project. Moving on to the next.

### Day 11: March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on the Heatmap Project.

**Thoughts:** Read the Getting Started section of YDKJSY and the first iteration of Dan Abramov's Just JavaScript: Mental Models. Also started working on the Heatmap project on FCC. I find it difficult to follow the docs, but it's definitely me. My understanding of data and visualization is very limited if not zero. But I'm positive I'll get through it. Back at it tomorrow.

### Day 12: March 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: JS Readings & Still Working on the Heatmap Project.

**Thoughts:** Finished my first read on YDKJSY, Get Started > CH2: Surverying JS. Finished Dan Abramov's CH2 of Just JavaScript > The JavaScript Universe. Although it's beginner content, I feel that I should still slowly read the content because I'm still a beginner. Finally making some significant progress on the heatmap project. Still some work to do, hopeful to finish this tomorrow.

### Day 13: March 4, 2020

## Today's Progress:

JS Readings & Still Working on the Heatmap Project.

## Thoughts:

**YDKJSY, Get Started > CH2**

Finished my reading on YDKJSY, Get Started > CH2: Digging to the Roots of JS. I really like the topics discussed in this chapter, and I'm looking forward to learning about Scopes and Closures a lot more. I want to master each piece of concept in JS if that's at all possible.

**Dan Abramov's CH3 of Just JavaScript > Values and Variables**

_My first thoughts on this first snippet:_

```JavaScript
let reaction = 'yikes';
reaction[0] = 'l';
console.log(reaction);
```

1. Assign the string 'yikes' to variable reacton.
2. Change the 1st index of the value in reaction to ths string 'l'. I think this throws an error because strings are supposed to be immutable?
3. Log the value stored in reaction.

As it turns out I'm correct. Cool! I also had to learn some markdown to properly edit this log. Another cool! XD.

_My first thoughts on this second snippet:_

```JavaScript
let pet = 'Narwhal';
pet = 'The Kraken';
console.log(pet); // ?
```

1. Assign string 'Narwhal' to variable pet.
2. Change the value of pet to string 'The Kraken'.
3. Log the value of pet. This will log 'The Kraken', because The value was reassigned and not edited (or mutated).

I also got the answer to this correctly. Nice!

The mental model of 'wires' connecting variables to values is really good. I'll keep it.

**FCC Heat Map Project**

Finally!!! Got 18/18 and submitted my project to the FCC learn site. Funny, I was working on getting the tooltip to show up, and when I solved it, I forgot how I did. I was trying to recall it, took a couple minutes. LOL! I'm just relieved I finally finished this one. Took a lot of reading and -- shhh.. -- copying.

**Markdown**

Did a little markdown reading to be able to write this log properly. Found this [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## **Day 14: March 5, 2020**

### **Today's Progress**

- **YDKJSY > Get Started > Ch4: The Big Picture**
- **Dan Abramov's Just Javascript > CH4 > Counting the Values (Part 1)**
- **Started working and Finished Choropleth Map for FCC project**

### **Thoughts**

- I'm really excited about the rest of the book. Hopefully I don't go through an unfinished section like the previous times I read YDKJSY.

- Glad this chapter is 2 parts. Numbers! Yikes!

- 12/12. That actually went easier than expected. Definitely not my finest work and not the greatest learning experience ever. This went by pretty fast. There are code that I don't fully understand but somehow I can imagine how it's working. I'll take this win and move on to the next and final project.

## **Day 15: March 6, 2020**

### **Today's Progress**

- **YDKJSY > Get Started > Appendix A: Exploring Further**
- **Dan Abramov's Just Javascript > CH4 > Counting the Values (Part 2)**
- **Started work on HeatMap for FCC project**
- **Finished Heatmap Diagram**

### **Thoughts**

- Nice to read about classes and objects, because I don't get to write much of them since I mostly code with React hooks, but I'm really looking forward to writing vanilla JavaScript with all these different functions and classes.

- The lesson is very concise and very clear. Smoothly transitioned from Part 1 as well. I think the idea of a function being a value is new to me, and my mind is still working on absorbing that information.

- 6/12. I was able to get the cells plotted on the page, but have absolutely no idea how the code worked so I decided to stop coding and read the documentations about the functions being used to plot this treemap project.

- I couldn't stop reading the docs and testing the example project's code on my own project. I refactored to use arrow functions, but I kept most of the variable names because they make most sense. I'm hoping to continue working on d3 projects even after finishing the freecodecamp full stack certification.

## Day 16: March 7, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- freeCodeCamp Full Stack Certification
- YDKJSY > Get Started > ApB: Practice, Practice, Practice!

### **Thoughts**

- Huge achievement! And noone to celebrate it with! Took about 7 months give or take. **Certificate Link:** [freeCodeCamp.org Full Stack Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/djma777/full-stack)
- **Practice, Practice, Practice!**:

  - **Practice Comparison:** [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/djma777/8011ae43cba029187af8b92ac79362a2)

Will continue all of these tomorrow including my _Just JavaScript_ reading.

## Day 17: March 8, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJSY > Get Started > ApB: Practice, Practice, Practice!
- Dan Abramov's Just JavaScript > Ch6 > Equality of Values

### **Thoughts**

- Huge achievement! And noone to celebrate it with! Took about 7 months give or take. **Certificate Link:** [freeCodeCamp.org Full Stack Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/djma777/full-stack)
- **Practice, Practice, Practice!**:

  - **Practice Closure:** [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/djma777/021184d8c0820a059137615a01f06ba6)

  Didn't code as much today, but I think I'm getting the hang of closures.

- The module was more of a Part 3 of values. I don't like the special cases, as it involves needing to memorize them. But, I'm sure I'll learn them with practice.

---

## Day 18: March 9, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJSY > Scope & Closures > Ch1: What is Scope?
- Brainstorming on portfolio project

### **Thoughts**

- My mind is preoccupied with thoughts about the portfolio project, but I still read through. I'm going to have to read the chapter again, until I understand the subject enough.
- I have a strong feeling that I should write my projects in TypeScript, so I started my react app with the TypeScript template. I wanted to use GatsbyJS but I was getting an NPM error which apparently is an existing issue since Oct 2019. I decided to go with CRA.
