### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: February 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** At first I thought, this being my 2nd time working on the project would be significantly easier, but it wasn't. My code, I believe is a lot cleaner that it was the first time, thought not yet at a level I'm satisfied at. I really like the progress I made since September last year: the working code I was able to write today, took me almost 3 weeks to accomplish 5 months ago. To be continued tomorrow...

### Day 1: February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp and revisiting Redux, data structures sections on the fcc curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I wrote quite a lot of custom hooks today. A lot for me at least. And I love it - not the pain in my head though. I'm still not passing some tests that I couldn't quite figure out, I decided to post for help on the fcc forum. Hopefully get some answers tomorrow, and finish the project with or without help. I felt that I needed to revisit some topics on the fcc curriculum and so I am doing just that.

### Day 2: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I refactored most of my code today, but still ended up with almost the same problem. I'm feeling optimistic that I will finish the project tomorrow.

### Day 3: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Well, I couldn't quite finish it today, but at least I got to 28/29. I'm hoping to get some answers from my freeCodeCamp forum post to help me solve the last test failure. It seems like a really eassy problem but I couldn't just figure it out for some reason. Looking forward to tomorrow.

### Day 4: February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp. 29/29. Finish the design tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I'm very pleased to have finally achieved 29/29 on the tests. I've barely started designing the app, but my brain is now to exhausted. I will finish this design tomorrow.

### Day 5: February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Pomodoro Clock project today. Small Victories!

**Thoughts:** I finished my basic design on the project, and cleaned up my files a bit. After these I'm revisiting redux, react-redux lessons on freecodecamp. It feels easy as expected -- what a relief, but I'm not going through like a breeze because I haven't mastered React and Redux at all. I will keep pushing!

### Day 6: February 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Revisiting D3JS lessons at freeCodeCamp in order to complete visualization certificate.

**Thoughts:** I've been considering myself a full stack javascript developer (very beginner level) for a few months now because I know both front end and back end, but I have yet to complete the freeCodeCamp full stack curriculum. I still need to finish the d3 projects (data visualization). Although I have finished the lessons a few months back, that time my mind was overloaded with all the fresh learning in HTML, CSS, Front end libraries, etc. Revisiting it now, to my surprise (but somewhat expected), I actually am absorbing the lessons much easier and I can dare say I actually understand the \*\*\*\* I'm reading. I'm stoked!

### Day 7: February 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning the D3JS docs for my freeCodeCamp Data Visualization Certification.

**Thoughts:** Today I spent more time reading the d3js docs than coding... Hoping I would be able to make some significant progress tomorrow. Also had some difficulty publishing to github pages. Maybe I'll make progress with that also by tomorrow.

### Day 8: February 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Bar Chart Project.

**Thoughts:** There is so much to learn in visualization. I'm finishing this project just getting the 14/14 score with very minimal details and design.

### Day 9: February 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Scatterplot Graph Project.

**Thoughts:** I haven't done much today. First half of the day we didn't have internet connection, so I binge watched the second half of Netflix's Altered Carbon. I was able to render the xAxis of the graph. Working on the yAxis, it is rendered on the correct side, but i'm still learning how the data is plotted. Back at this tomorrow.

### Day 10: March 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished Scatterplot Graph project 16/16.

**Thoughts:** I feel the guilt of cheating to pass a test... But, I have no other way of learning D3 but to see and study someone else's code and write it myself. The documentation isn't comprehensive enough for a newbie like me. I feel like you have to have actual knowledge in Data Science or Data Visualization itself, to be able to fully comprehend the D3 docs. But I'm confident I'm learning the code as I study and rewrite it for my project. Moving on to the next.

### Day 11: March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on the Heatmap Project.

**Thoughts:** Read the Getting Started section of YDKJSY and the first iteration of Dan Abramov's Just JavaScript: Mental Models. Also started working on the Heatmap project on FCC. I find it difficult to follow the docs, but it's definitely me. My understanding of data and visualization is very limited if not zero. But I'm positive I'll get through it. Back at it tomorrow.
