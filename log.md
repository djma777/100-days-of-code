### Day 0: February 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** At first I thought, this being my 2nd time working on the project would be significantly easier, but it wasn't. My code, I believe is a lot cleaner that it was the first time, thought not yet at a level I'm satisfied at. I really like the progress I made since September last year: the working code I was able to write today, took me almost 3 weeks to accomplish 5 months ago. To be continued tomorrow...

### Day 1: February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp and revisiting Redux, data structures sections on the fcc curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I wrote quite a lot of custom hooks today. A lot for me at least. And I love it - not the pain in my head though. I'm still not passing some tests that I couldn't quite figure out, I decided to post for help on the fcc forum. Hopefully get some answers tomorrow, and finish the project with or without help. I felt that I needed to revisit some topics on the fcc curriculum and so I am doing just that.

### Day 2: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I refactored most of my code today, but still ended up with almost the same problem. I'm feeling optimistic that I will finish the project tomorrow.

### Day 3: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Well, I couldn't quite finish it today, but at least I got to 28/29. I'm hoping to get some answers from my freeCodeCamp forum post to help me solve the last test failure. It seems like a really eassy problem but I couldn't just figure it out for some reason. Looking forward to tomorrow.

### Day 4: February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp. 29/29. Finish the design tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I'm very pleased to have finally achieved 29/29 on the tests. I've barely started designing the app, but my brain is now to exhausted. I will finish this design tomorrow.

### Day 5: February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Pomodoro Clock project today. Small Victories!

**Thoughts:** I finished my basic design on the project, and cleaned up my files a bit. After these I'm revisiting redux, react-redux lessons on freecodecamp. It feels easy as expected -- what a relief, but I'm not going through like a breeze because I haven't mastered React and Redux at all. I will keep pushing!

### Day 6: February 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Revisiting D3JS lessons at freeCodeCamp in order to complete visualization certificate.

**Thoughts:** I've been considering myself a full stack javascript developer (very beginner level) for a few months now because I know both front end and back end, but I have yet to complete the freeCodeCamp full stack curriculum. I still need to finish the d3 projects (data visualization). Although I have finished the lessons a few months back, that time my mind was overloaded with all the fresh learning in HTML, CSS, Front end libraries, etc. Revisiting it now, to my surprise (but somewhat expected), I actually am absorbing the lessons much easier and I can dare say I actually understand the \*\*\*\* I'm reading. I'm stoked!

---

### Day 7: February 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning the D3JS docs for my freeCodeCamp Data Visualization Certification.

**Thoughts:** Today I spent more time reading the d3js docs than coding... Hoping I would be able to make some significant progress tomorrow. Also had some difficulty publishing to github pages. Maybe I'll make progress with that also by tomorrow.

### Day 8: February 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Bar Chart Project.

**Thoughts:** There is so much to learn in visualization. I'm finishing this project just getting the 14/14 score with very minimal details and design.

### Day 9: February 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Scatterplot Graph Project.

**Thoughts:** I haven't done much today. First half of the day we didn't have internet connection, so I binge watched the second half of Netflix's Altered Carbon. I was able to render the xAxis of the graph. Working on the yAxis, it is rendered on the correct side, but i'm still learning how the data is plotted. Back at this tomorrow.

---

### Day 10: March 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished Scatterplot Graph project 16/16.

**Thoughts:** I feel the guilt of cheating to pass a test... But, I have no other way of learning D3 but to see and study someone else's code and write it myself. The documentation isn't comprehensive enough for a newbie like me. I feel like you have to have actual knowledge in Data Science or Data Visualization itself, to be able to fully comprehend the D3 docs. But I'm confident I'm learning the code as I study and rewrite it for my project. Moving on to the next.

### Day 11: March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on the Heatmap Project.

**Thoughts:** Read the Getting Started section of YDKJSY and the first iteration of Dan Abramov's Just JavaScript: Mental Models. Also started working on the Heatmap project on FCC. I find it difficult to follow the docs, but it's definitely me. My understanding of data and visualization is very limited if not zero. But I'm positive I'll get through it. Back at it tomorrow.

---

### Day 12: March 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: JS Readings & Still Working on the Heatmap Project.

**Thoughts:** Finished my first read on YDKJSY, Get Started > CH2: Surverying JS. Finished Dan Abramov's CH2 of Just JavaScript > The JavaScript Universe. Although it's beginner content, I feel that I should still slowly read the content because I'm still a beginner. Finally making some significant progress on the heatmap project. Still some work to do, hopeful to finish this tomorrow.

### Day 13: March 4, 2020

## Today's Progress:

JS Readings & Still Working on the Heatmap Project.

## Thoughts:

**YDKJSY, Get Started > CH2**

Finished my reading on YDKJSY, Get Started > CH2: Digging to the Roots of JS. I really like the topics discussed in this chapter, and I'm looking forward to learning about Scopes and Closures a lot more. I want to master each piece of concept in JS if that's at all possible.

**Dan Abramov's CH3 of Just JavaScript > Values and Variables**

_My first thoughts on this first snippet:_

```JavaScript
let reaction = 'yikes';
reaction[0] = 'l';
console.log(reaction);
```

1. Assign the string 'yikes' to variable reacton.
2. Change the 1st index of the value in reaction to ths string 'l'. I think this throws an error because strings are supposed to be immutable?
3. Log the value stored in reaction.

As it turns out I'm correct. Cool! I also had to learn some markdown to properly edit this log. Another cool! XD.

_My first thoughts on this second snippet:_

```JavaScript
let pet = 'Narwhal';
pet = 'The Kraken';
console.log(pet); // ?
```

1. Assign string 'Narwhal' to variable pet.
2. Change the value of pet to string 'The Kraken'.
3. Log the value of pet. This will log 'The Kraken', because The value was reassigned and not edited (or mutated).

I also got the answer to this correctly. Nice!

The mental model of 'wires' connecting variables to values is really good. I'll keep it.

**FCC Heat Map Project**

Finally!!! Got 18/18 and submitted my project to the FCC learn site. Funny, I was working on getting the tooltip to show up, and when I solved it, I forgot how I did. I was trying to recall it, took a couple minutes. LOL! I'm just relieved I finally finished this one. Took a lot of reading and -- shhh.. -- copying.

**Markdown**

Did a little markdown reading to be able to write this log properly. Found this [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## **Day 14: March 5, 2020**

### **Today's Progress**

- **YDKJSY > Get Started > Ch4: The Big Picture**
- **Dan Abramov's Just Javascript > CH4 > Counting the Values (Part 1)**
- **Started working and Finished Choropleth Map for FCC project**

### **Thoughts**

- I'm really excited about the rest of the book. Hopefully I don't go through an unfinished section like the previous times I read YDKJSY.

- Glad this chapter is 2 parts. Numbers! Yikes!

- 12/12. That actually went easier than expected. Definitely not my finest work and not the greatest learning experience ever. This went by pretty fast. There are code that I don't fully understand but somehow I can imagine how it's working. I'll take this win and move on to the next and final project.

## **Day 15: March 6, 2020**

### **Today's Progress**

- **YDKJSY > Get Started > Appendix A: Exploring Further**
- **Dan Abramov's Just Javascript > CH4 > Counting the Values (Part 2)**
- **Started work on HeatMap for FCC project**
- **Finished Heatmap Diagram**

### **Thoughts**

- Nice to read about classes and objects, because I don't get to write much of them since I mostly code with React hooks, but I'm really looking forward to writing vanilla JavaScript with all these different functions and classes.

- The lesson is very concise and very clear. Smoothly transitioned from Part 1 as well. I think the idea of a function being a value is new to me, and my mind is still working on absorbing that information.

- 6/12. I was able to get the cells plotted on the page, but have absolutely no idea how the code worked so I decided to stop coding and read the documentations about the functions being used to plot this treemap project.

- I couldn't stop reading the docs and testing the example project's code on my own project. I refactored to use arrow functions, but I kept most of the variable names because they make most sense. I'm hoping to continue working on d3 projects even after finishing the freecodecamp full stack certification.

## Day 16: March 7, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- freeCodeCamp Full Stack Certification
- YDKJSY > Get Started > ApB: Practice, Practice, Practice!

### **Thoughts**

- Huge achievement! And noone to celebrate it with! Took about 7 months give or take. **Certificate Link:** [freeCodeCamp.org Full Stack Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/djma777/full-stack)
- **Practice, Practice, Practice!**:

  - **Practice Comparison:** [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/djma777/8011ae43cba029187af8b92ac79362a2)

Will continue all of these tomorrow including my _Just JavaScript_ reading.

---

## Day 17: March 8, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJSY > Get Started > ApB: Practice, Practice, Practice!
- Dan Abramov's Just JavaScript > Ch6 > Equality of Values

### **Thoughts**

- Huge achievement! And noone to celebrate it with! Took about 7 months give or take. **Certificate Link:** [freeCodeCamp.org Full Stack Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/djma777/full-stack)
- **Practice, Practice, Practice!**:

  - **Practice Closure:** [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/djma777/021184d8c0820a059137615a01f06ba6)

  Didn't code as much today, but I think I'm getting the hang of closures.

- The module was more of a Part 3 of values. I don't like the special cases, as it involves needing to memorize them. But, I'm sure I'll learn them with practice.

## Day 18: March 9, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJSY > Scope & Closures > Ch1: What is Scope?
- Brainstorming on portfolio project

### **Thoughts**

- My mind is preoccupied with thoughts about the portfolio project, but I still read through. I'm going to have to read the chapter again, until I understand the subject enough.
- I have a strong feeling that I should write my projects in TypeScript, so I started my react app with the TypeScript template. I wanted to use GatsbyJS but I was getting an NPM error which apparently is an existing issue since Oct 2019. I decided to go with CRA.

---

## Day 19: March 10, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- _REREAD_ YDKJSY > Scope & Closures > Ch1: What is Scope?
- Learning about **TypeScript**

### **Thoughts**

- Today's reading is much better than yesterday. I can't say I understand 100%, but I definitely understand better. Looking forward to tomorrows chapter.
- Wow! I'm so excited about TypeScript. Feels like there's so much to learn and that it will help me write programs better.

---

## Day 20: March 11, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJSY > Scope & Closures > Ch2: Illustrating Lexical Scope
- Stepping back from TypeScript for now.
- Nextjs Tutorial.
- Idea for Portfolio site.

### **Thoughts**

- Such a long way to really master JS and programming in general and I love it. I can undertand code compilation a little better now because of this chapter.
- I decided to not go with TypeScript for now. I feel that I should really learn it slowly, after realizing that it's going to slow me down significantly at my current level. I would want to write some small toy projects in TypeScript first, then maybe refactor my bigger projects for more practice.
- I also Barry Allen-ed myself in the Nextjs tutorial, it was really good, and it seems easy. ZEIT seems to also be a nice platform it's FREE. I didn't know how I would be able to deploy a nextjs site before so I learned gatsby first.
- Looks like my idea for my personal portfolio is finally coming together. Nothing is final, but, I'm looking at writing 3 sites (excluding project/client sites): 1 main site, 1 gatsby site (dev blog), and a nextjs site (gamer blog). Excited!

## Day 21: March 12, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJSY > Scope & Closures > Ch3: The Scope Chain
- Working on Idea for Portfolio site.

### **Thoughts**

- Not much to say about the book chapter. I think pretty much these are topics that I already know, but have to master the nuances of it. I'm sure I'll have to reread the chapter again, but I will do so after the whole book.
- We're getting there, I think my idea is really solidifying in my mind. Like, I think I'm getting the original feel that I've always wanted. My previous attempts at making a personal portfolio site felt like a copy of other websites. This time is different. I'm very excited. More work!

## Day 22: March 13, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJSY > Scope & Closures > Ch4: Around the Global Scope
- Working on Idea for Portfolio site.

### **Thoughts**

- Will need to reread this chapter the next time around.
- So much time, so little progress. I want to be disappointed, but, I really am still learning as I go. What's nice is that I know where I'm going. One step at a time. Baby steps.

## Day 24: March 15, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJSY > Scope & Closures > Ch6: Limiting Scope Exposure
- Small progress on folio site.

### **Thoughts**

- What I can recall from my reading is that code readability is really important. And I know it is even before reading about it. The concepts being taught in this book is very important for me to learn and master. But I know I couldn't master JS with one run on this book. It might take 100.
- Making small progress on my site. Added top and bottom nav bars for the layout. Still contemplating on the content. The UX is also still on the works in my mind. We'll get there.

## Day 25: March 16, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJSY > Scope & Closures > Ch7: Using Closure
- Small progress on folio site.

### **Thoughts**

- Closure is a really important part of programming. I haven't mastered it yet, but I have a clear understanding of how it works now.
- Making small progress on my site. Used react spring for some animations.. animated my burger menu and navlinks.
- I looked into TensorFlow a bit. I was looking for a side project that would help my brain unwind from my main one - my folio. ML sounded really interesting, but seems really complicated for me at the moment. I still need a side project, dunno what this is supposed to be called.

## Day 27: March 18, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- YDKJSY > Scope & Closures > ApA: Exploring Further
- Experimenting on Material UI on the site

### **Thoughts**

- Hmm... I can't say for sure what I was able to learn, but, I'm sure that I've so much to keep learning. This is definitely not my first run on this book. Will go back as many times as I need to.
- Did some experimenting on Material UI components on my site. Not a lot of progress to keep, but progress nonetheless. Back at this tomorrow.

- Experimenting on Material UI on the site

### **Thoughts**

- I couldn't concentrate but read through the article. Will reread it tomorrow and reflect on it on my next log.
- Had difficulties integrating styled components with material ui. Currently reading and experimenting on material ui's own style method.

## Day 29: March 20, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Dan Abramov's Just JavaScript > 7 > Properties **Re-read**
- Getting sucked in deeper by Mui

### **Thoughts**

- Today's reading was a lot better than yesterday. Need more practice though.
- I found myself unintentionally getting sucked in even deeper by Mui, and I'm not sure if I like it, or more accurately: if this is a good thing. But I will go on with it, I think there will be no loss in learning Mui more. I'd probly gain a lot more if anything. Hopeful that tomorrow I will find it easier to use Mui.

## Day 33: March 24, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- More Gatsby!
- Some Webpack
- Yes same stuff!

### **Thoughts**

- I'm actually rather pleased with my progress today. I have to say, the difference of how I understand Gatsby now than my first run a few months ago is almost night and day. No, their docs didn't improve but it is sufficient, I just got better - not a whole lot but BETTER.
- Still working on learning webpack as well, going pretty good. I could say the same that I can understand the docs a lot better than my first run.

- FCC backend review

### **Thoughts**

- Just taking a day break from the Gatsby route, back at it tomorrow!

- I might start to learn unity they have 3 months free premium.

- fcc advanced express and nodejs review on going
- howtographql authentication

### **Today's Progress**

- fcc review
- howtographql authentication

### **Thoughts**

- took a lot of time to finish the lessons but it was really worth it, only goes to show that I have lots to learn even the ones I thought I already know
- finish the howtographql authentication part, run into some bugs and fixed them, attention to detail can make or break a developer

## Day 42: April 2, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- finished the howtographql nodejs tutorial
- looked into apollo graphql
- working on league fan proj

### **Thoughts**

- most of the day was spend finishing the howtographql nodejs tutorial... a long way to go before I get comfortable with it...
- I might use apollo server instead since it more popular
- got the filter to work... still need a lot of work, and design, and I haven't even decided on the main feature and other features of this app

## Day 43: April 3, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- more apollo graphql
- kompit server & client
- working on league fan proj

### **Thoughts**

- for some reason at the end of today I feel like I accomplished nothing, but I actually spent 90% of the day coding, it's weird.. as I write this log, I honestly couldn't quite recall exactly what things I did
- was able to deploy the heroku app with the apollo-server-express api with just one query LOLs but it's working! also the client is working. just a matter of time to make things more complex - one step at a time
- added square imgs pulled from the riot api

## Day 44: April 4, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- working on league fan proj

### **Thoughts**

- today was all about the LoL fan proj. Spent more time than I wanted to figure out the layout and events. But it was all worth it because i'm still learning. haven't yet figured out how touch events work coz it didn't work in my code. wrote a custom hook to listen for mouse enter events.

## Day 46: April 6, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- working on league fan proj, re-learning redux

### **Thoughts**

- I think I understand the basics of redux now, but still ran into a problem. But I think I also figured how my app can work without redux, or I realized I didn't really need it (yet). Majority of my time was spend figuring out the layout, which I still haven't solved. I got the react-router working and making pages for each hero. Ran into a js method problem, trying to iterate through an object with a `for of` of an object literal while destructing the result of `Object.entries()`. I'm trying to return jsx but the loop seems to stop on the first item. Will try to figure this out tomorrow.

## Day 47: April 7, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- fixed lol proj bug.
- installed wsl (took a loooong time)

### **Thoughts**

- was able to fix the routing bug with a simple google solution
- was able to install wsl 1 initially but immediate bumped into a bug about renaming files/folders which is supposed to be solved in wsl 2. installing wsl 2 required me to sign up for windows insider and install an update which took most of my day. actually it isn't even finished yet while i'm writing this.

### **Today's Progress**

- postponing card flip
- postponing wsl 2
- breaking down the champion data in to components in my league api project

### **Thoughts**

- i guess today is much like a rest day but I still wrote some code...
- won't be doing the card flip for now, i guess until the project is done then card flip would be an update
- breaking down the champ data into single components and started a bit of styling (like 0.1% started)

### **Today's Progress**

- CRA live reload on wsl 2 now working
- worked on my league of legends project

### **Thoughts**

- I feel very relieved and excited that I'm finally in the correct directory to work on wsl 2. and after changing the default directory for windows terminal the live reload for cra is finally working. woo hoo! let's go!!!!!
- refactored some of my components from the project. still deciding on which data I should keep on the champion pages. because I still haven't figured out how to interpret some of the texts from the api. hopefully I find a guide or something.

## Day 53: April 13, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Found a new cdn that has good no-need-to-parse data about champions spells, but...
- installed docker but don't know how to use it yet

### **Thoughts**

- the problem with the new cdn is that I couldn't use it in local development yet, found a lead on how to resolve it and will see how it goes tomorrow...
- took some time installing docker stuff that I don'w know how to use... but I will probly get to it soon...

## Day 54: April 14, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- CRA proxy working
- refactored data fetching to use react-query and fetch from a different source

### **Thoughts**

- glad I found the cra proxy option.. and it works. so far so good, I was able to fetch champions data. hopefully it will work for other features that I want to implement
- refactored my code to use react-query for caching options and it has more features to offer that I can learn, and also to use a more dependable data source for my league of legends project.

## Day 55: April 15, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Victory from yesterday was short lived
- starting PokeAPI project...

### **Thoughts**

- It's sad, I thought everything was going to go smoothly from yesterday's victory. So, I've no idea as of yet how to make the champion data render in production. For some reason it works in development but not in the production build hosted in gh pages. I'll need some time to figure it out, but I want to work on a project that will let me work without such complications, so I'm looking for a better public api for now, putting my league of legends project on hold.
- PokeAPI, hopefully things go smoothly. At the same time, I am thinking about just proceeding with my KOMPIT project. I might actually just work on that tomorrow. We'll see...

## Day 56: April 16, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- I really didn't like leaving the LoL project
- postponing PokeAPI proj.

### **Thoughts**

- I just really love the game than any other api choices... I looked more into it, and the good guys at the discord server of riot devs and dev community were kind enough to give me leads. at this point, I see three possible solutions:
  1. create my own proxy server
  2. use the heroku cors-anywhere server
  3. use aws lambda - or other serverless services
- I'm really leaning towards the 3rd option, because I'm very interested to learn and use AWS services, as well as GCP and/or Azure. These are part of my learning goals as a developer.
- sadly, I don't love pokemon as much as I do pc gaming. But I might still really work on this project in the future.

## Day 58: April 19, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- decided to start working on my league of legends backend

### **Thoughts**

- I will have to replace the Kompit server with this new backend project. As it turns out this is going to be a Full Stack project anyways Front and Back - not sure about db though.

## Day 59: April 20, 2020.

- trying to build a graphql server for the riot league of legends api

### **Thoughts**

## Day 60: April 21, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- still unable to convert data to my graphql server

### **Thoughts**

- still stuck at trying to server data from ddragon into my apollo graphql server, continuing work on this tomorrow...

---

## Day 61, 62, 63, 64: April 22, 23, 24, 25 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- was able to serve the simple data to get myself started...

### **Thoughts**

- the last couple of days I spent visiting my code and brainstorming how I would structure the data I'm serving, do I use class or do I use json. Also, updating my laptop takes so much time, literally, almost a whole day for an update. I consider that time as coding time as well, coz even though i'm not writing code, I think code, and I dream code.

---

## Day 65: April 29, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- success on serving champion name from dataSources api

### **Thoughts**

- been quite distracted this past few days for a few reasons including covid19, but I never stopped thinking about this project. today I was able to serve in gql playground the champion name from the dataSource api. This is big because I've already written most of the types I need, and I just need to write a lot of boilerplate code to serve most of these data. I'll continue this tomorrow. I'm very optimistic about tomorrow's progress.

---

## Day 66: May 02, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Wrote a lot of boilerplate for my resolvers. Implemented a 2nd api.

### **Thoughts**

- Yes I skipped yet another few days. Been a bit busy tutoring and distracted watching some netflix without chilling. I was able to write a few boilerplate code for my resolvers and also implemented the 2nd data source for my proxy api server. Quite successful today, haven't hit a bump that's too hard. I'm happy with that.
- Ubuntu 20.04 feels really responsive significantly. I love it!!!

---

## Day 67: May 04, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- finished individual champion data resolvers for both DDragon and Meraki api's

### **Thoughts**

- finally, I finished my champion resolvers for both the said api sources. everything seems to be working fine. will have to figure out how to resolve `getChampions tomorrow, then items after that.

---

## Day 68: May 06, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- `getChampions` endpoint seems to work now

### **Thoughts**

- Looks like I'm done with the champions api, I'm now thinking about whether to create a production build now so that I can build my frontend app, or should I proceed with the items. Hmm... will continue this tomorrow. Also, if I am to create a prod build, I have to learn how to use environment variables and webpack (again). This is so exciting.

---

## Day 69: May 07, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- learned a bit about environment variables today

### **Thoughts**

- while I reviewing topics about environment variables, I'm also revisiting webpack in node. apparently you need to set target=node in your webpack config if you're using express (not sure if it's the same for when you're not using expressjs).

---

## Day 70: May 08, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- deployed League of Legends GraphQL API to Heroku

### **Thoughts**

- so apparently, I had to also have Heroku install my devDependencies. Since by default doesn't do so, I learned that I needed to set `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` to `false` on the Heroku settings. After adding this environment variable and manually deploying, the api is now successfuly deployed.

## Day 71: May 10, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Apollo Client working on the frontend

### **Thoughts**

- breaking my frontend app to use my apollo server. So far, I was able to connect my apollo client to my server. and I can extract data. the challenge is just refactoring my app to use the server instead of connecting to the api sources directly.

---

## Day 72: May 11, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- `getChampion` api is working

### **Thoughts**

- hit some humps today on the frontend, but boiled down to writing the wrong query on the frontend. still continuing to refactor my code, progress I'm not so sure, maybe 25%.

---

## Day 73: May 18, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- cleaned my code

### **Thoughts**

- I think my apollo client refactoring is coming together. Although my laptop really is frustrating, I'm still feeling determined that I'll get through this slump. I need some design ideas for my frontend app.

## Day 79: June 18, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- started doing react projects

### **Thoughts**

- I quit entirely on Coding Addict's react projects and decided to start my own. although I did shop for Udemy courses that has projects, and I didn't have enough money on my prepaid card apparently to buy one. So I just have to start my own from scratch.

## Day 80: June 19, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- bcrypt and signup api to work

### **Thoughts**

- After a gruelling day of trying to get bcrypt to work for my signup functionality it finally worked. I have to be honest, I feel that there's a fundamental concept that I'm missing which is the reason that took me hours to do this. On the other hand, I think it's also just experience and that this knowledge will come to me with time and effort.

## Day 81: June 20, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- jwt somehow working

### **Thoughts**

- another full day of coding, and I feel very happy, not because of how much I got working, but by how much my brain is hurting... feels bubbly could burst any second LOL. but seriously, this is the pain of learning even though I'm not sure what I'm learning omega LOL.
- ok, so I got `jwt.sign()` working... I wrapped it in a promise because initially I was having problem using the asynchronous way, so after a few hours I reviewed how to to write a `Promise` constructor and voila, it worked.

---

## Day 82: June 21, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- Happy Fathers' Day!
- refactored some code, jwt seems to working

### **Thoughts**

- It's fathers' day yey! I haven't seen my daughter for 6 1/2 years of her life and she's 7 years old... but I believe that God has a greater plan that I cannot fathom, I trust His will, and I will keep on keepin' on!
- I refactored some of my express server code to use middlewares instead of helper functions, I gotta say it looks a lot better now.
- I still have a bit of confusing as to when and when not to use async functions. At the moment I just think that I want to use it almost everywhere to avoid blocking, or something like that.
- After getting the `/signup` to seem to work with the jwt, I started looking into my client side app, well there's zero work in there just a starter CRA app. very quickly I find myself studying Formik, and this is actually exactly why I wanted to start the client app now. progress in the server gradually and then also the client. That way I think I'm learning Full Stack Development. Nice!

## Day 83: June 23, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- sign up form working

### **Thoughts**

- so my sign up form is working, as well as a delete all button bumped a bit of typos.. and my brain is tired

---

## Day 84: June 24, 2020.

### **Today's Progress**

- login form working

### **Thoughts**

- the only challenge I had today which took me some time to figure out was that I couldn't log the updated state after fetching data inside the my `async handleSubmit()`. The way I solved it (sort of) was that I just rendered a div if the state changed and that worked. I think the reason the log wasn't successful was because there was not re-rendering happening so there's nothing to trigger a `console.log`. I only figured out that might be the case after actually rendering the div for the updated state.
