##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: February 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** At first I thought, this being my 2nd time working on the project would be significantly easier, but it wasn't. My code, I believe is a lot cleaner that it was the first time, thought not yet at a level I'm satisfied at. I really like the progress I made since September last year: the working code I was able to write today, took me almost 3 weeks to accomplish 5 months ago. To be continued tomorrow...

### Day 1: February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp and revisiting Redux, data structures sections on the fcc curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I wrote quite a lot of custom hooks today. A lot for me at least. And I love it - not the pain in my head though. I'm still not passing some tests that I couldn't quite figure out, I decided to post for help on the fcc forum. Hopefully get some answers tomorrow, and finish the project with or without help. I felt that I needed to revisit some topics on the fcc curriculum and so I am doing just that.

### Day 2: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I refactored most of my code today, but still ended up with almost the same problem. I'm feeling optimistic that I will finish the project tomorrow.

### Day 3: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Well, I couldn't quite finish it today, but at least I got to 28/29. I'm hoping to get some answers from my freeCodeCamp forum post to help me solve the last test failure. It seems like a really eassy problem but I couldn't just figure it out for some reason. Looking forward to tomorrow.

### Day 4: February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still Working on V2 of my Pomodoro Clock project for freeCodeCamp. 29/29. Finish the design tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I'm very pleased to have finally achieved 29/29 on the tests. I've barely started designing the app, but my brain is now to exhausted. I will finish this design tomorrow.

### Day 5: February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Pomodoro Clock project today. Small Victories!

**Thoughts:** I finished my basic design on the project, and cleaned up my files a bit. After these I'm revisiting redux, react-redux lessons on freecodecamp. It feels easy as expected -- what a relief, but I'm not going through like a breeze because I haven't mastered React and Redux at all. I will keep pushing!
